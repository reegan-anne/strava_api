expected, changes in altitude and the distance have the highest correlations with the moving time. Max elevation also shows low correlation as the terrain in higher altitudes can be more challenging than in lower altitudes. Interestingly the difficulty score doesn't seem to correlate as much with the moving time. This might be due to several reasons: The difficulty score of a whole tour is based on the most difficult section, it is set by users and thus varies due to subjectivity, a difficult track may be exposed and only for experienced hikers, but it is not automatically terrain which slows one down.\n","\n","## Building the models\n","\n","### A strong baseline\n","Before putting too much time into a sophisticated model it is important to develop a simple baseline which serves as an anchor point to benchmark any other model against it.
